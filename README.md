Odin Project Lesson: Javascript/jQuery @ 37% through the Lesson

I started of by doing my own thing, somewhat inspired by only reading the first
part of the directions and interested in making my own thing. I did that for a
while and I am happy with the results.

Buttons 1-3 all create equally sized divs
no matter the number entered in the prompt(1-64).
Button 1 lets you peck away one square at a time.
Button 2 toggles classes from the light-gray to black and continues to do so on
mouseenter until you click again.
Button 3 randomizes the color of the square on mouseenter and continues to do so,
until you exit the page or hit one of the buttons to clear the squares.

Buttons 4-6 use what was requested by the Odin Project to make squares based on
the user prompt and the size of the container.
Button 4 is a drop in opacity by 0.1 every mouseenter and double click toggles to
an all white box.
Button 5 is random colors again, but does it on the Odin Project style and all
black background.
Button 6 is a trail that eventually goes back to black. I found this on RebootJeff's
github page and I wanted to try it out for myself. pretty cool. He has a great
project too. I used his for inspiration when I didn't now what I wanted to do next.
